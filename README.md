# LLM Task Automation Project

This project demonstrates an LLM-assisted automation system that can **build, deploy, and update web applications dynamically** based on JSON task requests. It handles multiple types of tasks, including CAPTCHA solvers, calculators, and other interactive apps.

---

## Project Overview

1. **Build Phase**  
   - Receives a JSON POST request containing the task brief, email, secret, round, and attachments.  
   - Validates the secret provided.  
   - Uses pre-defined Python handlers to generate a minimal application according to the task brief.  
   - Pushes the application to a public GitHub repository with an MIT license.  
   - Deploys the web app to GitHub Pages.

2. **Evaluate Phase**  
   - Sends the repo and Pages URL back to the evaluation API.  
   - Supports dynamic checks, static code evaluation, and LLM-assisted content verification.

3. **Revise Phase**  
   - Accepts a second POST request (round 2) for updates or new features.  
   - Validates the secret again, updates the repo, redeploys, and reports back to the evaluator.

## Project Structure

The project adheres to a modular structure for clear separation of duties (API, Agent, and Handlers).

**Core Components**

**main.py**: The FastAPI server entry point.The central task coordination logic. It parses the task brief and handles the LLM API call. It receives tasks, schedules background processing, and executes the crucial authenticated Git deployment (clone, commit, push).

**requirements.txt**: Lists all required Python dependencies for the environment.

**Dockerfile**: Defines the environment for containerized deployment.

**index.html**: Sample HTML page generated by tasks

**.github/workflows/** : GitHub Actions workflow for GitHub Pages deployment

**deploy-pages.yml**
